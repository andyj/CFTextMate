欢迎 - Welcome
============

大家好！Welcome to the ColdFusion Textmate bundle.  This bit of code will create a [Textmate][textmate] bundle that contains all the tags, functions, and a few basic templates for the CFML language.

The input to this process is an XML dictionary file in the [cfeclipse][cfeclipse] dictionary format.  This means that if you happen to have a cfeclipse dictionary, you can use this code to create a compliant Textmate bundle (with a bit of tweaking of course).

Building
========

There are a few things you'll need before you can compile the code.  The first thing you need is [Apache Ant][ant] (Free).  Ant comes pre-installed on Mac OS 10.5 Leopard, so you should have that already.  Type "ant" in the terminal to see if you have it.  If you do not have it, you'll need to [download][ant] and set it up before you can compile.

The second thing you'll need is [Saxon 9][saxon] (Free).  [Saxon 9][saxon] is an XSLT 2.0 engine.  You can use another XSLT 2.0 engine, but you'll need to do some tweaking.  After you've [downloaded][saxon] and setup [Saxon 9][saxon], edit the build.xml file to set the correct path to the Saxon jar file.
	
Once both Ant and Saxon are in place, you can build the build with the following command:
	
	$ant build

Additionally there are some bash scripts that show examples of how you can build releases using other grammars.
	
The `build` task will break up the dictionary and create the Coldfusion.tmbundle.  See the `build.xml` for more information.
